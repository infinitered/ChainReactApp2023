        "Are you satisfied with your test suites? If you said no, you’re not alone—most developers aren’t. And testing in React Native is harder than on most platforms. How can you write JavaScript tests when the JS and native code are so intertwined? And what in the world are you supposed to do about that persistent act() warning? Faced with these challenges, some teams are never able to make any progress testing their React Native app, and others end up with tests that don’t seem to help and only take extra time to maintain.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. There are two great testing tools custom-built for the React Native ecosystem: React Native Testing Library (RNTL) and Detox. In this full-day workshop you’ll learn the tools, techniques, and principles you need to implement tests that will help you ship your React Native app with confidence. You’ll walk away with a clear vision for the goal of your component and end-to-end tests and with techniques that will help you address any obstacle that gets in the way of that goal.",

        "Our ancestors once asked, “should my app use Expo or plain React Native?” Under the glow of their CRT’s, they recounted epic trials at the fork in the road between Mount Bare and Managed Valley, an agonizing decision that foretold an eventual showdown with The Dreaded Eject. Ah, but kids these days! They no longer have to walk to school uphill both ways in three feet of snow, and they can quickly integrate whatever Expo tools enhance their workflow *right now*. From the viewpoint of its evolution, let’s explore the modern Expo landscape, where any React Native app can take advantage of Expo modules, EAS Build, and more. Learn how today’s Expo adapts as you need to customize your native projects, speeds up local development, and provides complex build setups to a simple configuration file. We’ll wrap up with a look towards a future where using Expo unlocks even more of the best patterns from web development while balancing the unique complexities of mobile.",

Learn about the tools and processes we used to ensure a smooth and stable app launch while releasing to additional regions. See how we managed a weekly release process, how we monitored errors and pushed updates, and how we worked with other teams (GQL, web, stakeholders, vendors) to manage breaking changes.

        "In the React space, there’s always a lot going on - and with that, a lot of emotions that can swing in both good and bad ways: how many times we’ve seen a hot take on Twitter generating drama? That, paired with a lack of communication from who’s in the driving seat, can create a lack of trust towards this awesome technology. But behind the scenes, there is a dedicated group of developers working to improve the underlying infrastructure of React Native. This work is focused on making the technology more robust, better structured, and ultimately more reliable. In this talk, I'll take you on a deep dive into the inner workings of these discussions and highlight some of the radical changes that are being made. My hope is that by shining a light on this under-appreciated work, I can help restore your faith in the future of React Native.",

Extending a platform out of tree comes with its own set of challenges. Enabling Microsoft experiences via that platform adds the hurdle of meeting Microsoft's compliance, reliability, and migration requirements. In this talk, you'll get an inside look at Microsoft's journey of building and consuming React Native Windows. Discover the current efforts to bring the platform up to Microsoft's quality standards and hear about exciting case studies of Office and Windows apps already using React Native Windows for cross-platform support, rapid iteration, and more.

        "Have you ever wanted to contribute to Open Source but don’t know where to start? Are you using React Native daily and would like to improve it or suggest changes? We've got you covered! Contributing to a big Open Source project like React Native can be daunting, and you may feel lost, not knowing where to start. Codegen is one of the Pillars of the New Architecture, and it’s a crucial component to help developers be more efficient by writing boilerplate code for you. It turns out that Codegen is also a great component to kick off your first contribution to the core of React Native, as it’s self-contained and has extensive test coverage. In this talk, we will walk through the Codegen codebase and implement a new feature. This will allow you to get familiar with the codebase, understand the various moving parts and learn how to get your first pull request landed on main!",

        "For web developers building in the mobile ecosystem for the first time, deploying cross-platform apps built with React Native can be complex. There are native build hardware and config requirements, signing certificates, app store approvals, app versions, pushing updates, and more. There are multiple tooling options and strategies to consider, including whether to automate and whether to integrate with existing web CI/CD processes. This talk serves as an overview of the React Native-specific deployment considerations. It covers the key differences between mobile and web, how to develop a deployment strategy, and how to evaluate tooling options. We'll cover what makes mobile different, the key components of a mobile deployment process, automation considerations, and toolkit considerations (framework-specific, web CI/CD, or mobile CI/CD options.)",

He once wrote hundreds of unit tests and dozens of integration tests for a codebase he was working on (we’re not kidding). Pushing himself to new heights is perhaps the reason why he enjoys hiking so much. He loves hiking around the Pacific Northwest, but his favorite is a series of hikes in Colorado that all cross 14,000 feet in elevation (it’s almost tiring just to think about).

        "Frank is the type of software engineer that knows how to navigate his way around the inner workings of a project. He’s all about tracking metrics and making measurable improvements. With a background in compliance software, he can breeze through complexities others find intimidating. Perhaps that’s why he also feels at home in the gym bodybuilding or learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu – he likes focusing on the small details that add up to big wins. Originally from New York, it’s no surprise that Frank is always on the lookout for a good slice of pizza or a shot of espresso (something he may not find until he visits Portland, at least according to our west coast group).",

She also believes in meeting people where they are – which is why accessibility is core to her approach as a software engineer. She will always push for her projects to be more accessible to users. Lizzi’s meticulous approach to work is perhaps why she looks for the unexpected in the world: whether it’s enjoying improv comedy, a Dungeons & Dragons show, or exploring what art the latest AI algorithm can generate.",
